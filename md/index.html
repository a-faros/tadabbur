 19:[41-50] The story of Ibrãhïm and his idol worshipping father <br>
 19:[51-57] The Prophethood of Musa, Isma‘il and Idrïs <br>19:[58-65] All prophets of Allah were Divinely Guided and chosen <br>
 19:[66-82] Believers and unbelievers‘ life in this world and their life in the Hereafter <br>
 19:[83-98] No god other than Allah will be able to save you on the Day of Judgement. Those who say Allah has begotten a son, preach such a monstrous lie that even the Heavens may crack, earth split and mountains crumble to pieces. Allah has made the Qur‘an easy for mankind <br>
 20:[1-8] The Qur‘an is a reminder for those who fear Allah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth <br>20:[9-16] The Prophet Musa went to the sacred valley of ‘Tuwa‘ at Mount Tür <br>20:[17-24] Allah chose him as His Rasool and assigned him towards Fir‘on <br>
 20:[25-48] Prophet Musa prayed to Allah to open his heart, ease his task and remove the impediment from his speech so that people may understand, what he says. Allah granted his request and reminded him about His favors <br>20:[49-54] Dialogue between Musa and Fir‘on <br>
 20:[55-64] Human life cycle. Fir‘on disbelieved Musa by calling his miracles a magician‘s trick and challenged him to confront his magicians in public - Musa accepted the challenge <br>20:[65-76] The confrontation of Musa and Fir‘on‘s magicians. The magicians after witnessing Musa‘s miracle, accepted Islam. Dialogue between the magicians and Fir‘on <br>

 20:[129-132] Do not envy others in worldly benefits, rather seek Allah‘s pleasure if you want to attain the blessed end <br>20:[133-135] The Qur‘an is a sign from Allah so there can be no excuse for the unbelievers on the Day of Judgement <br>
 21:[1-10] The Day of Accountability is getting closer, but the disbelievers are still heedless to the admonition and dispute as to how a human being can be a Rasool <br>
 21:[11-15] Prior nations were destroyed due to similar iniquities <br>21:[16-18] The creation of the heavens and earth is not a game <br>21:[19-24] If there were more than One God, the heavens and earth would have been in a state of disorder <br>Message: All Rasools were sent with the same <br>21:[25-29] ‘There is no god but Allah, so worship Him Alone.‘ <br>
 21:[30-33] The skies and earth once were one mass; Allah split them asunder, and He created all living things from water <br>21:[34-41] Allah has not granted immortality to any human being. If Rasools are doomed to die, how are disbelievers going to live forever? <br>
 21:[42-47] Invented gods cannot even defend themselves; how will they defend the unbelievers against Allah? The scale of justice shall be set up on the Day of Judgment <br>21:[48-50] Musa was given Al-Furqãn (the criterion of right and wrong), so is this The Qur‘an <br>
 21:[51-71] Ibrãhïm questioned the idol worshipping of his father and his people. Ibrãhïm broke all their idols to show that the gods who cannot even defend themselves, cannot be of any benefit to them. They decided to burn him alive but Allah commanded the fire to be cool and comfortable for Ibrãhïm <br>21:[72-75] Allah blessed Ibrãhïm with a son (Ishãq) and then a grandson (Ya‘qoob) and made each of them prophets <br>

 21:[94-97] Whoever does good deed, provided he is a believer, his endeavor will not be rejected <br>21:[98-106] The Day of Judgment and the fate of the disbelievers and believers <br>21:[107-112] Allah has sent Muhammad (pbuh) as a blessing for all the worlds (humans, jinns, and others) <br>

 22:[34-38] It is not the meat or the blood of the sacrificed animals that reaches Allah, it is your piety that reaches Him <br>
 22:[39-41] Permission is granted to the believers to fight in self defense, and for the cause of Allah <br>22:[42-45] O Muhammad, you are not the only one being denied, all Prophets were denied before you <br>22:[46-48] A day of your Rabb is equal to 1000 years of your calculation <br>
 22:[49-51] Acceptors of Truth shall be forgiven, while others punished <br>22:[52-57] Shaitãn tampered with the wishes of all Rasools, but Allah abrogated such interjection. On the Day of Judgement, Allah Himself shall be the Judge for all <br>
 22:[58-64] Those who migrated for the sake of Allah shall be generously rewarded. Allah is the only One Who is Real, all other deities are false <br>
 22:[65-67] Allah is the One Who has given you life, causes you to die and will bring you back to life for passing on His Judgement <br>22:[68-72] Allah will judge between you concerning matters in which you differ <br>
 22:[73-74] Gods besides Allah have no power to create even a creature like a fly <br>22:[75-78] Allah named the believers Muslims in the prior scriptures and also in this (The Qur‘an) <br>
 23:[1-11] Characteristics of true believers <br>23:[12-16] Stages of human creation <br>23:[17-22] Allah has made the heavens, vegetation, trees and animals for the benefit of human beings <br>
 23:[23-30] The Prophet Nüh was sent to guide his people - they disbelieved him and as a result Allah drowned all disbelievers in the great flood <br>23:[31-32] After the Prophet Nüh, Allah sent Hüd to guide his people <br>
 23:[33-44] They called the Prophet Hüd an imposter; as a result, Allah destroyed them all in a mighty blast. After Hüd, Allah sent Rasools to other people; those people also denied and faced a similar punishment <br>23:[45-50] Musa was sent to Fir‘on and his chiefs; they also disbelieved and faced destruction <br>
 said: Allah has <br>23:[51-61] ‘In fact, your religion is one religion; I am your Rabb, so fear Me Alone.‘ <br>23:[62-77] Allah has not charged any soul with more than it can bear. Those who do not believe in the hereafter will ever stray away from the Right Path <br>
 23:[78-83] Allah has given you ears, eyes and hearts but you seldom show gratitude <br>23:[84-90] Even the disbelievers recognize the existence of Allah <br>23:[91-92] Allah never begotten a son, nor is there any other god besides Him <br>
 23:[93-98] Repel evil with good and seek refuge with Allah against the temptations of Shaitãn <br>23:[99-111] The wrongdoers will wish that they could be sent back to this world to adopt the Right Way, but it will be too late <br>23:[112-115] On the Day of Judgement it will appear as if the life of this world was less than one day <br>23:[116-118] The unbelievers will never attain salvation <br>

 24:[35] Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. <br>24:[36-38] Allah‘s Light is found in the places of worship which are built for His remembrance by His devotees. <br>24:[39-40] Deeds of unbelievers are like a mirage in a sandy desert. <br>
 24:[41-45] Every thing in the heavens and earth glorifies and praises Allah. Allah has created every living creature from water. <br>24:[46-50] Those who claim to be the believers but do not demonstrate their belief through actions are not true believers. <br>
 say: True believers are those who, when called towards Allah and His Rasool, <br>24:[51-57] ‘We hear and we obey.‘ <br>

 25:[45-50] Allah has made the night a mantle, sleep to rest, and the day to work <br>25:[51-60] Do not yield to the unbelievers; make Jihãd against them with The Qur‘an. Put your trust in Ever-Living (Allah), Who will never die <br>

 26:[192-207] The Qur‘an is revealed in plain Arabic by Allah through angel Gabriel; those people who do not want to believe will not believe <br>shaitãns: The Qur‘an is not brought down by <br>26:[208-220] it is neither in their interest nor in their power <br>26:[221-227] Shaitãns descend on slandering sinners, who listen to hearsay and are liars <br>
 27:[1-6] The Qur‘an is a Guide and Good News to the Believers <br>27:[7-14] The story of the Prophet Musa‘s selection as a Rasool. Nine signs were shown to Fir‘on but he still disbelieved and incurred Allah‘s punishment <br>

 27:[59] Praise to Allah and peace be on His Rasools <br>
 27:[60-66] Just think, is there any god besides Allah Who has created anything in the universe, answers the oppressed or guides to the Right Way? <br>
 27:[67-82] The disbelievers doubt Allah‘s power of creation. The Qur‘an clarifies those matters in which the Israelites differ. A sign from the signs of Doomsday <br>
 27:[83-86] Do not deny Allah‘s revelations without gaining their comprehensive knowledge <br>27:[87-93] A scene from the Doomsday. Those who accept guidance do so to their own good and those who go astray do so to their own peril <br>
 28:[1-3] Story of the Prophet Musa <br>28:[4-13] Fir‘on plotted to kill the sons of the Israelites to save his kingship, while Allah planned to bring up one of them in Fir‘on‘s own household <br>

 29:[1-7] Allah tests the believers to see, who is truthful and who is a liar? <br>29:[8-13] Be kind to your parents but do not obey them in the matter of shirk. Those who say, ‘Follow us, we will bear your burden‘, are liars. <br>
 29:[14-22] Nüh admonished his people for 950 years not to commit shirk. Likewise, Ibrãhïm admonished his people not to commit shirk. <br>
 29:[23-27] The people of Ibrãhïm even tried to burn him alive but Allah saved him. Ibrãhïm‘s nephew Lüt was the only one who affirmed his belief with him <br>29:[28-30] The Prophet Lüt was appointed as a Rasool towards the nation of homosexuals <br>

 29:[64-69] The life of this world is nothing but pastime, the real life is the life hereafter. Those who strive in Our cause, We do guide them to Our Way <br>
 30:[1-10] The Roman‘s (Christians‘) defeat at the hands of the Persian (Pagans) was taken as a sign of the Muslims‘ defeat at the hands of Arab unbelievers, so Allah gave good tidings for the Roman victory as well as the Muslim victory in a few years <br>
 30:[11-19] It is Allah Who originates creation and then repeats it and to Him everyone will be brought for the final Judgement <br>
 30:[20-27] The creation of man, his consort, heavens, earth, language, colors, sleep, quest for work, lightning, rain and growth of vegetation - all are signs of Allah <br>
 30:[28-32] The wrongdoers are led by their own desires without real knowledge.

 31:[20-24] Main reason for misguidance is the blind following of one‘s forefathers <br>31:[25-30] Mushrikïn admit that Allah is the Creator of the heavens and the earth. If all the trees were pens and the oceans were ink, the writing of Allah‘s words could not be exhausted. Allah is the only reality, all others to whom people invoke besides Him are false <br>
 31:[31-34] O mankind, fear that Day when no father shall avail his son nor a son his father. Let not the Shaitãn deceive you concerning this fact <br>
 32:[1-11] The Qur‘an in which there is no doubt, is revealed by Allah to Muhammad, so that he may warn those people to whom no Warner has come before <br>
 32:[12-14] On the Day of Judgement, the unbelievers shall believe but that belief will be of no benefit to them <br>32:[15-22] There is a special reward for those who forsake their beds and invoke their Rabb with fear and hope and spend in charity <br>
 32:[23-30] The Qur‘an is similar to the Book which was given to the Prophet Musa <br>
 33:[1-3] Fear Allah and do not obey the unbelievers and hypocrites <br>33:[4-5] By word of mouth neither your wives become your mothers nor adopted sons become your real sons <br>33:[6-8] The Prophet‘s wives are the believers‘ mothers. Blood relations have greater claims than others in the Book of Allah <br>
 33:[9-11] Favors of Allah during the battle of Trench <br>33:[12-15] The attitude of the Hypocrites during the battle of Trench <br>33:[16-20] Those who discourage others from participating in the fight against the unbelievers and don‘t participate in such a war themselves have no faith and all their deeds will be null and void <br>
 33:[21-24] The Life of Rasool Allah (Muhammad) is the best Model for you <br>33:[25-27] Allah helped the Muslims gain victory over the unbelievers and the Jewish tribes in Madinah and Khayber <br>
 33:[28-30] Admonition to the wives of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) <br>
 33:[31-34] Allah‘s commandment to the wives of the Prophet Muhammad <br>
 33:[35-36] It is not fitting for believers to have option in what has been decided by Allah and His Rasool <br>33:[37-40] Allah commanded the Prophet Muhammad to marry the divorced wife of his adopted son. Muhammad is not the father of any of your men but a Rasool and Seal of the Prophethood <br>
 33:[41-48] The Prophet is sent as a bearer of good news, as a Warner and as a lamp spreading light <br>33:[49-52] Divorce when no Iddat (waiting period for remarriage) is required. Special permission for the Prophet Muhammad to marry more than four wives. Restriction on the Prophet to marry or exchange the present wives after this commandment <br>
 33:[53-55] Do not enter the houses of the Prophet without permission, and if invited, do not seek long conversation. Do not marry the Rasool‘s wives after his death <br>33:[56-58] Allah Himself and His angels send blessings on the Prophet, O believers do the same <br>

 33:[69-73] O believers! Fear Allah and always say the right thing. The heavens, earth and mountains refuse to take the Trust (freedom of choice) but man took it <br>
 34:[1-5] The Hour is surely going to come and Judgement shall be established to reward the believers and punish those who discredit Allah‘s revelations <br>34:[6-9] Those who do not believe in the hereafter are doomed <br>
 34:[10-14] The mountains and birds used to sing Allah‘s praise with the Prophet Dawõõd. Allah subjected the winds and Jinns to the Prophet Sulaimãn. Claim of people that Jinns know the unseen is wrong <br>34:[15-21] The people of Sabã rejected Allah‘s blessings and disbelieved in the hereafter, so Allah made them merely a tale of the past <br>
 34:[22-30] No intercession before Allah can avail anyone except for whom He permits it. The Prophet Muhammad is sent for the entire mankind <br>
 34:[31-36] Those who disbelieve in the Qur‘an and prior scriptures, will have yokes placed around their necks before being tossed into hell. Wealth and children are not the indications of Allah‘s pleasure <br>
 34:[37-45] It is belief that brings you close to Allah, not the wealth or children. Whatever you spend in charity, Allah will pay you back. Unbeliever‘s statements about the Prophet and Al-Qur‘an <br>
 34:[46-50] The unbelievers are asked to ponder upon their wrong statements. The truth has come, falsehood neither originates nor restores anything <br>34:[51-54] On the Day of Judgement the unbelievers will want to believe but it will be of no avail to them <br>
 enemy: None can withhold or award blessings besides Allah. Shaitãn is your <br>35:[1-7] so take him as such <br>
 35:[8-9] That person who considers his evil deeds to be good, cannot be guided to the Right Path <br>35:[10-11] Let all those who are seeking honor know that real honor is in the obedience of Allah <br>35:[12-14] Allah has created water, day, night, the sun and moon for man‘s benefit. Deities besides Allah can neither hear, nor response nor yet own even a thread of a date-stone <br>
 35:[15-18] Mankind is in need of Allah, while He is not in need of anyone <br>35:[19-26] The living and the dead are not alike. You cannot make those who are buried in the grave hear you <br>
 35:[27-37] Those who recite the Qur‘an, establish Salah and give charity may hope for Allah‘s blessings and rewards. Those who disbelieve, shall have a painful punishment in the hellfire forever <br>
 35:[38-41] Allah has not sent any Book which has a provision of Shirk (worshipping anyone else besides Allah) <br>35:[42-45] Plotting evil recoils none but the author of it. If Allah was to punish people for their wrong doings, He would have not left even an animal around them <br>
 36:[1-12] The Qur‘an is revealed by Allah to warn people. The Prophet is told that he could warn only those who have the fear of Allah <br>

 36:[68-76] The Qur‘an is to warn those who are alive and establish charge against the disbelievers <br>36:[77-83] Allah, Who has created man, shall give him life again for accountability on the Day of Judgement <br>
 37:[1-11] Allah testifies that your God is one God and that shaitãns do not have excess to the exalted assembly of angels <br>37:[12-21] Life in the hereafter and the Day of Judgement are real <br>
