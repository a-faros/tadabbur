Surah al-Fatihah 

Introduction 

- The   word *surah* literally   stands   for   height   or   elevation.   Perhaps   the   chapters   of   the   Qur’an 

  have   been   called   by   this   term   because   they   raise   the   reader   from   one   stage   of   knowledge   and spiritual   advancement   to   another   (i.e.   higher).  Another   meaning   of   the   word *surah* is   wall   or fortification   of   a   city,   so   perhaps   the   chapters   of   the   Qur’an   are   called   by   this   because   each chapter   encompasses   many   verses   within   itself   and   guards   them   from   spilling   into   other   parts 

  of   the   Qur’an   [Zaheer] 

- The   word *ayah* ,   usually   translated   as   verse,   literally   means   a   sign   or   miracle.   It   is   as   if   every verse   of   the   Qur’an   is   a   sign   of Allah   and   a   miracle   in   itself   [Zaheer] 
- There   is   a   difference   of   opinion   among   the   scholars   whether *Basmalah*  before   the   beginning   of each *surah* is   part   of   the   of   the   Qur’an   or   not 
- *Basmalah* is   referring   to   the   phrase   in   the   beginning   of   each *surah* : *In   the   name   of  Allah, the   Entirely   Merciful,   the   Especially   Merciful* 
- The   statement   means,   “I   begin   with   the   name   of Allah,”   or   “I   began   with   the   name of Allah”   [Ibn   Jawzi] 
- The   name   ‘Allah’ 
  - There   is   a   debate   on   the   word   ‘Allah’  whether   it   is   derived   from  Arabic   root letters   or   not   [Ibn   Jawzi] 
    - Some   said   it   is   a   proper   name   for   the   Deity   as   is   and   has   no   root 
    - Some   said   it   is   derived   from  Arabic   root   letters 
  - Some   said   it   is   inclusive   of   all   of Allah’s   beautiful   Names   [Sa’di] 
- All   of   the   following   is   taken   from   the   book *al-Tafseer   al-Muyassar* : 
- *Al-Fatihah* literally   means   ‘The   Opening’  because   the Quran   opens   with   it.   It   is   the   first chapter   ( *surah* )   of   the   Qur’an   and   is   considered   its   greatest *surah* 
- It   is   seen   to   be   a   precise   table   of   contents   of   the   Qur’anic   message   because   some scholars   of   exegesis   have   stated   that   this   chapter   is   a   summary   of   the   whole   Qur’an 
- It   has   other   names   as   well,   such   as,   the   Mother   of   the   Book,  The   Cure,  The Commendation   ( *Hamd* ),   and   others 
- Another   name   is *The   Seven   Oft-Repeated* because   it   is   recited   repeatedly   in   the 

  five   daily   prayers 

Tafseer of the Verses 

**1.  [All]   praise   and   thanks   is   [due]   to  Allah,   Lord   of   the   worlds** 

a.  The  Arabic   word *hamd* (praise) 

1. It   is   a   combination   of   two   meanings:   praise   and   gratitude 

1\.  Why   did  Allah   use   one   word   ( *hamd* )   to   refer   to   both   and   not   separate between   the   two? 

1. Because   the   best   type   of   speech   is   that   which   is   little   and   gets   the point   across. This   is   part   of   eloquence 
1. Separating   the   two   would   make   it   seem   as   if Allah   sometimes 

   deserves   thanks   and   at   other   times   praise,   rather ,   He   always 

   deserves   both   together 

2. *Hamd* is   something   that   is   done   only   for   the   living   and   necessitates   sincerity 

1\.  Another word in Arabic used for praise is *madh*  ( ﻣﺪح), which can be done towards   someone   without   sincerity 

1. Ex:   a   poet   praising   an   unjust   king 
3. The   word   is   used   as   a   noun   in   the   sentence   to   indicate   that *hamd*  of   Him   is timeless   and   permanent.   Meaning   that  Allah   always   deserves   praise 

1\.  Everything   that   He   does   deserves   to   be   praised 

2. The  Arabic   word *shukr* (gratitude) 
1. In   the   context   of   this   verse,   it   means   to   show   gratitude/appreciation   for   whatever He   does   for   us   in   our   lives 
1. The   main   problem   with   atheists   is   that   they   do   not   appreciate   God.  They   lack *shukr* 
1. They   cannot   get   themselves   to   be   grateful   to   Him 
1. They   always   complain   about   Him 

a.  Why   does   God   allow   evil?   Why   is   it   not   like   that?   Why   did   He   do that? 

3. In   the   first   verse,   He   uses   His   name   ‘Allah’  and   not   one   of   His   attributes 

i.  This   is   in   order   to   ascertain   that   there   is   no   confusion   as   to   who   is   being   referred to.  Allah   is   saying   that   it   is   Him   alone   and   not   other   false   deities   that   deserve *hamd* 

1\.  Also   mentioning   an   attribute   alone   could   give   the   impression   that   we   are only   thanking   Him   due   to   that   one   specific   attribute 

4. Sentences   can   be   for   information   purposes   or   for   emotion.  The   latter   type   is   not categorized   into   true   or   false 
   1. The   word *alhamdulillah* is   meant   for   both   types 
4. The  Arabic   phrase  *Lillahi Al-Hamd* (to  Allah   belongs all   praise)   means   [true]   praise   only belongs   to  Allah   alone   and   nobody   else   because   He   is   the   cause   of   everything 

i.  He   sustains   His   creation   in   two   ways,   general   and   specific   [Sa’di]: 

1. In   general   terms,   this   refers   to   His   creation   of   all   creatures,   His   granting   of provision   to   them   and   His   guiding   them   to   that   which   is   in   their   best interests,   which   enables   them   to   survive   in   this   world 
1. In   specific   terms,   it   refers   to   His   cherishing   of   His   close   friends,   by   means of   instilling   faith   in   their   hearts,   guiding   them   to   it,   perfecting   it   for   them   and warding   off   from   them   distractions   and   obstacles   that   come   between   them and   faith.   In   real   terms,   this   means   guiding   them   to   everything   that   is   good and   protecting   them   from   everything   that   is   bad.   Perhaps   it   is   for   this 

   reason   that   most   of   the   supplications   of   the   Prophets   used   the   word   Lord 

   ( *Rabb* ),   since   all   their   requests   and   needs   came   under   His   special cherishing 

6. The  Arabic   word *Rabb* 
1. It   can   mean   the   giver   of   gifts,   caretaker,   maintainer   (make   sure   something   does 

   not   die),   owner,   etc. 

1. This   is   the   secondary   meaning   in   this   verse 
1. It   refers   to   a   beings   who   creates   a   thing   and   then   develops   it   gradually,   in steps,   until   it   has   achieved   its   optimum   development   [Zaheer] 
2. It   can   also   mean   Master 
1. This   is   the   primary   meaning   in   this   verse 
1. This   is   our   main   relationship   with   Him.  The   summary   of   the   whole   Quran   is that:   He   is   our   Master   and   we   are   His   slaves 
1. It   should   not   be   confused   with   the   way   we   think   about   master/slave relationship   in   the   West   during   the   slave   trade 
   1. We   belong   to  Allah   and   He   has   complete   power   and   control   over us.   We   do   not   and   cannot   set   limits   on   Him   but   He   sets   limits   on   us. He   will   judge   us   on   the   Day   of   Judgment   and   we   will   not   judge   Him 
1. It   comprises   the   ideas   of   having   a   just   claim   to   the   possession   of   anything and,   consequently,   authority   over   it   [Zaheer] 
1. Usually   masters   in   this   world   punish   their   slaves   immediately   for   not following   rules   but  Allah   allows   us   to   keep   indulging   in   acts   of disobedience   without   immediate   consequences 

g.  The  Arabic   word *‘alameen* (worlds) 

1. It   can   have   multiple   meanings: 
   1. Nations   of   people 
   1. Ethnicities   of   people 
   1. Societies   of   people 
   1. Different   species   (angels,   jinn,   animals,   etc.) 
   1. People   of   different   worlds 
   1. Generations   of   people 
1. Since   this *surah* is   only   discussing   the   conditions  of   people,   as   we   read   in   the later   verses,   it   may   be   that  Allah   is   using   this   word   to   only   refer   to   humans   and their   worlds.  All   of   us   are   living   in   our   own   little   worlds 
1. Some   opine   that *‘alameen* is   in   reference   to   everything other   than  Allah   [Sa’di] 

**2.  The   Entirely   Merciful,   the   Especially   Merciful** 

a.  The   origin   of   both   words,   al-Rahman   and   al-Raheem,   is   mercy   ( *rahmah* ) 

i.  They   are   put   together   here   in   one   sentence   to   highlight   the   difference 

1. Ar-Rahman   [three   benefits   meant   here] 
1. Someone   extremely   merciful 
1. Something   happening   right   now 
1. It   is   temporary   (transient) 
1. This   means   it   may   be   taken   away   if   you   do   something   wrong 
2. Ar-Raheem   [two   benefits   meant   here] 
1. It   is   permanent   –   always   there   and   never   going   to   go   away 
1. It   is   not   necessarily   happening   right   now 
2. Both   words   used   here   to   show   that  Allah   is   being   Merciful   to   His   creation   right now   as   well   as   in   the   future 
2. Some   also   said   that   the   word   al-Rahman   means   a   more   general   type   of   mercy 

   that   covers   all   of   His   creation,   whereas,   the   word   al-Raheem   means   that   there   is a   special   type   of   mercy   which   He   gives   only   to   the   believers   [Zaheer] 

2. To   the  Arabs,   mercy   ( *rahmah* )   meant   when   someone   is   completely   taken   care   of   and covered 

i.  Ex:   a   baby   in   the   womb   of   its   mother 

1\.  This   is   why   the   word   for   womb   ( *rahim* )   in Arabic   is derived   from   the   same root   as   mercy 

3. Allah’s   mercy   is   so   vast   that   we   cannot   comprehend   it 
3. **Master   of   the   Day   of   Judgment** 
1. On   that   day,   we   will   all   answer   precisely   for   our   deeds 
1. It   is   a   day   in   which   we   will   be   brought   back   to   life   and   repaid   for   what   we   have done,   all   of   His   creation   will   be   held   accountable   for   their   actions   and recompensed   for   them   [ *al-Mukhtasar   fee   al-Tafseer* ] 
1. On   that   day,   kings   and   subjects,   slaves   and   free,   will   all   be   equal   and   will   submit fully   to   His   might,   awaiting   the   reckoning,   hoping   for   His   reward   and   fearing   His punishment   [Sa’di] 
2. The   word *maalik* ,   translated   here   as   ‘Master’,   means  that   He   is   the   owner   of   that   day and   its   king 
   1. An   owner   pays   attention   to   details,   whereas   a   king   concerns   himself   with   big things.  Allah   does   both 
   1. Allah   is   saying   that   great   day   when   judgment   will   take   place   is   owned   by   Him 
2. The   Day   of   Judgement   has   been   specifically   mentioned   because   His   absolute   lordship will   be   apparent   to   everyone   that   day   when   no   one   else   will   possess   lordship   besides Him   to   any   degree   [Zaheer] 
2. There   are   only   two   kinds   of   people   on   that   great   day 
   1. Those   who   will   receive   His   mercy 
   1. Those   who   will   receive   His   Justice   (i.e.   punishment) 
2. In   the   recitation   of   this   verse,   Muslims   are   reminded   in   every   unit   of   their   prayers   of   the Day   of   Judgment.   It   serves   as   an   encouragement   for   them   to   prepare   themselves through   righteous   actions   and   to   abstain   from   disobedience   and   evil   deeds   [ *al-Tafseer al-Muyassar* ] 
2. To   mention   the   Day   of   Judgment   after   the  Attributes   of   His   Mercy   is   perhaps   to   remind man   that   although  Allah   is   Kind   and   Merciful,   He   has   also   to   be   Just   with   all   of   His creation. Accordingly,   He   has   appointed   a   day   when   everyone   will   have   to   recompense 

   for   the   wrongs   he   committed   to   others   and   draw   retribution   for   the   wrongs   he   suffered   at the   hands   of   others   [Zaheer] 

4. **You   ˹alone˺   we   worship   and  You   ˹alone˺   we   ask   for   help** 
1. Meaning   we   intend   and   make  You   exclusive   in   worship,   which   is   obedience   with [complete]   submission   [Al-Wahidi] 
1. When   the   previous   three   verses   are   understood   properly,   it   will   naturally   lead   to this   conclusion 
1. Meaning   of   worship 
   1. Many   of   the *tafseer* books   define   it   as   obedience   with   humility   and submission   [Al-Baghawi] 
   1. Some   opine   worship   refers   to   everything   that  Allah   loves   and   is   pleased with   of   actions   and   words,   both   outward   and   inward   [Sa’di] 
1. Allah   alone   deserves   to   be   worshiped   because   He   alone   is   the   bestower   of   all blessings,   the   greatest   of   which   is   the   gift   of   life   [Raazi] 
2. Another   meaning   is   that   we   give   ourselves   to  Allah   in   totality 
   1. We   can   only   truly   be   free   when   we   enslave   ourselves   to   our   Creator 
2. The   words   ‘master’  and   ‘guidance’  are   very   frequently   mentioned   together   in   the   Qur’an 

i.  Guidance   is   a   set   of   instructions 

1\.  A  master   can   only   be   a   master   if   he   is   giving   instructions   else   he   is   not   a master.   Hence, Allah   is   our   master,   thus,   He   gives   instructions   to   His slaves   (i.e.   guidance) 

4. The   meaning   of   the   second   part   of   the   verse: *You   ˹alone˺ we   ask   for   help* 
1. It   means   help   in   matters   we   are   currently   struggling   with 

1\.  You’re   telling  Allah,   “O Allah   I   am   already   trying   to   do   this   but   struggling, 

so   please   help   me   because   I   cannot   do   it   by   myself” 

a.  We   do   not   rely   on   supplication   alone,   rather,   we   make   attempts   on our   own   with   it   as   well.   We   cannot   just   sit   in   our   house   without           making   any   effort   and   just   rely   on   supplication.   We   have   to   do   both 

2. Seeking   help   refers   to   relying   upon  Allah   when   seeking   to   attain   what   is 

   beneficial   and   ward   off   what   is   harmful,   whilst   trusting   that   one   will   attain   that [Sa’di] 

5. The   first   part   of   this   verse   is   related   to   worship,   which   means   our   primary   task   is   to   be 

   His   slave   and   submit   to   Him.  The   second   part   relates   to   seeking   His   aid 

i.  It   is   mentioned   in   this   order   because   worship   and   submission   is   for   Him, 

whereas,   seeking   His   aid   is   for   us.  The   first   qualifies   us   for   the   second   part, 

which   means   if   we   are   not   submitting   ourselves   to   Him,   then   we   do   not   qualify   for His   aid 

1\.  Others   said   worship   is   mentioned   before   seeking   help   by   way   of 

mentioning   what   is   general   before   what   is   specific,   and   also   to   give precedence   to  Allah’s   dues   over   those   of   His   slaves   [Sa’di] 

6. Some   also   suggest   that   the   second   part   of   the   verse   (seeking   His   aid)   is   requesting 

   Allah   to   help   us   with   the   first   part   of   the   verse   (worshiping   and   submitting   to   Him) 

7. In   this   verse,   there   is   healing   for   the   hearts   from   the   disease   of   attachment   to   other   than Allah,   as   well   as   from   the   ailments   of   showing   off,   vanity,   and   pride   [ *al-Mukhtasar   fee al-Tafseer* ] 
7. The   whole   of   Islam   revolves   around   two   principles:   worship   of Allah   and   trust   in Allah. The   former   negates   any   association   with Allah   while   the   latter   signifies   trust   and dependence   on   none   other   than   Him   [Zaheer] 

**5.  Guide   us   to   the   straight   path** 

1. This   is   the   number   one   thing   we   should   be   asking   for 

i.  Meaning   show   and   facilitate   for   us   the   right   way,   the   path   of   submission   to  You which   has   no   crookedness,   and   make   us   firm   upon   it   [ *al-Mukhtasar   fee al-Tafseer]* 

1\.  A  Muslim   is,   at   all   times   and   in   all   situations,   in   need   of Allah’s   help   in remaining   steadfast   on   the   Path   of Allah,   in   firmly   establishing   himself   on   it and   in   continuing   with   determination   [Zaheer] 

2. Why   is   the   plural   ‘we’  being   used? 

i.  Because Allah   is   telling   us   that   we   all   should   ask   together   as   a   community 

1\.  We   will   not   survive   by   ourselves,   rather ,   we   must   do   things   together   as   a community 

3. This   is   so   important   that   we   ask   for   it   in   every   unit   of   prayer   when   we   recite   the *Fatiha* 
3. We   are   asking  Allah   in   this *surah* for   things   we   need and   not   what   we   have 
3. Increase   in   knowledge   does   not   mean   increase   in   guidance 
   1. You   have   to   ask   for   guidance   and   beg   for   it 
   1. A  person   can   have   knowledge   but   no   guidance 
   1. We   should   also   not   let   knowledge   become   a   fashion 
3. The  Arabic   word *siraat* (path) 
1. Comes   from   a   word   meaning   a   long   straight   sword 
1. Here   it   means   one   straight   path   which   cannot   have   multiples 

1\.  There   is   only   one   path   to   God 

a.  The   word *siraat* is   not   written   as   a   plural   because it   is   alone   and 

can   only   be   one   straight   path.  There   is   only   one   path   to  Allah, which   is   Islam,   not   multiple 

3. This   path   is   wide,   straight,   long,   and   dangerous   due   to   attacks   from   the   devils 
3. It is the Prophet ﷺ who showed us this straight path so there  is no way for the servant   to   attain   happiness   except   by   staying   firm   upon   this   upright   path 

   [ *al-Tafseer   al-Muyassar* ] 

7. The  Arabic   word *mustaqeem* (straight) 
   1. It   means   to   stand   up   straight 
   1. It   is   to   imply   that   the   path   leads   straight   upwards   to   the   heavens 
7. The   next   verse   tells   us   what   this   straight   path   is   [Sa’di] 

**6.  The   path   of   those   upon   whom  You   have   bestowed   favor** 

1. Meaning   the   same   path   as   those   of Your   creation   whom  You   have   blessed   with 

   guidance,   such   as   the   prophets,   the   truthful,   martyrs,   and   the   righteous   ones 

   [ *al-Mukhtasar   fee   al-Tafseer* ] 

i.  Because   they   are   people   [who   received]   guidance   and   remained   firm   on   it 

[ *al-Tafseer   al-Muyassar* ] 

2. It   is   in   reference   to   those   righteous   people   that   have   already   died   upon   truth   and righteousness.   It   is   not   referring   to   those   who   are   currently   alive   because   they   can   still go   astray.  This   is   why   the   past   tense   verb   is   used   in   this   verse 
2. The   words: *You   have   bestowed   favor* 
1. Meaning  Allah   made   it   easy   for   them 
1. The  Arabic   word *‘anama* (favor) 
1. Comes   from   a   word   meaning   something   soft   and   easy 
1. It   is   also   used   to   refer   to   cattle   because   these   animals   are   real   relaxed 
4. There   is   clear   evidence   in   this   verse   that   the   obedience   that   the   faithful   demonstrate,   is not   their   own   achievement.   Rather,   it   is   by  Allah’s   leave   and   the  *tawfeeq* (ability) granted   to   them   by   Him   [Zaheer] 
4. The   verse   also   is   hinting   that   the   ‘path’  is   not   a   hypothetical,   imaginary   or   an   ideal   one. Rather,   it   is   a   real   and   tangible   one:   one   on   which   people   have   walked   before   and   have met   with   success   [Zaheer] 
4. We   also   learn   from   this   verse   that   it   is   essential   to   seek   the   company   of   those   who   have been   favored   by  Allah.   Mere   study   of   books   might   not   be   enough   [Zaheer] 

**7.  Not   of   those   who   have   evoked   [Your]   anger   or   of   those   who   are   astray** 

1. The  Arabic   phrase *maghdhoobi   ‘alayhim* (those   who   evoked  [Your]   anger) 
1. The  Arabic   phrase   refers   to   someone   whom   everybody   else   is   mad   at,   thus,   he   is receiving   lots   of   anger 
   1. The   ‘everybody’  in   the   context   of   the   verse   implies  Allah,   angels, believers,   etc. 
1. It   is   interesting   to   note   that  Allah   does   not   refer   to   Himself   in   this   verse,   as   in   the previous   verse,   it   is   as   if   He   does   not   even   want   to   be   mentioned   with   them   in   the same   sentence.   He   is   distancing   Himself   away   from   them 
1. This   is   in   reference   to   people   who   were   given   knowledge,   thus,   they   knew   the truth   but   chose   not   to   follow   it 

1\.  Ex: the Jews who denied the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ despite him clearly being   mentioned   in   their   books 

2. The  Arabic   word *dhaalleen*  (those   who   are   astray) 
1. The  Arabic   word   refers   to   those   who   got   lost 
   1. This   is   the   opposite   of   guidance 
1. It   is   in   reference   to   those   who   do   not   know   any   better   and   are   ignorant,   however , their   ignorance   in   this   case   is   not   an   excuse 
1. They   were   neglectful   in   seeking   the  Truth   and   being   guided   by   it [ *al-Mukhtasar   fee   al-Tafseer]* 
1. Ex:   the   Christians   who   say  Allah   is   one   of   three 
3. Allah   used   nouns   to   refer   to   the   two   groups   mentioned   in   this   verse   because   such people   will   always   exist 

Conclusion 

- Knowledge   is   when   we   follow   it   with   action 
- Whoever   knows   the   truth   and   followed   it   is   more   deserving   of   the   straight   path 

  [ *al-Tafseer   al-Muyassar* ] 

- The   straight   path   is   knowing   the   truth   and   acting   upon   it   [Sa’di] 
- All   of   humanity   can   be   categorized   into   three   categories: 
  - Those   whom   He   favored 
  - Those   with   whom   He   is   angry 
  - Those   who   got   lost 
- One   of   the   lessons   this   surah   teaches   us   is   that   we   should   not   consistently   do   things   that   we know   are   forbidden   by  Allah 
  - Because   it   can   cause Allah   to   be   angry   with   us   or   being   lost   as   a   punishment   to   the point   that   we   can   never   get   guidance   again 
- This   chapter   talks   about   both:   individual   and   collective *eemaan* (faith) 
- *Iyyaka   na’budu* is   the   conclusion   of   first   part   of   the   chapter   and *wa   iyyaka   nasta’een* is   the conclusion   of   the   second   part   of   it
